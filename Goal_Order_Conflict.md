## Goal-Order Conflicts:
It is when the users have set up a rule that might conflict with their will at particular conditions or moments. In such cases, the system may decide to prioritize the predefined goal\footnote{Such prioritization could be based on user-defined rules or some intelligent algorithm of the system} instead of the direct command and act consequently. It hence may compel the system to avoid performing orders by the user.

### Scenario:
  >It is 7 pm, and there is a pile of dirty dishes in the dish washer. Bob would like to wash them before dinner but the dish washer does not start after Bob had turned it on. The reason is that the \textit{Smarthome Manager} has deactivated the dish washer because Bob has set up a rule to reduce the electric consumption at peak times (usually from 6 to 9 pm).
