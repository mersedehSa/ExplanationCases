## User Fault:
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Under this category, we analyze the situations where the intelligent behavior of the system is the source of confusion. So, users require some explanation to interpret the particular act of the system. In modern IoT systems and smart environments, the system often has a ubiquitous and comprehensive knowledge of other linked systems, environment as well as users' actions, goals, and preferences. It enables the system to learn users tastes and better recommend a suitable course of steps for the user to follow and to perform context-aware decisions and activities in various directions-- from home automation to personalized graphical user interface generation and context-aware access control for smart devices <sup>[[1]](#1),[[2]](#2)</sup>, to name a few--. Though the context-awareness of the system is meant to maximize user satisfaction and comfort, the autonomous and automated nature of decision making of the system or lack of transparency of reasons behind a particular recommendation may confound the users. Subsequently, some explanation can acquaint the user with the cause, purpose, and benefit of such suggestion and behavior of the system.  </div>
