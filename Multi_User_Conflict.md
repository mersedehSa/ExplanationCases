## Multi User Conflict
In a smart environment with multiple users, such as the smart home or smart office, every user may have its own goals and preferences, which may conflict with other user’s actions at some conditions or moments. Hence, the \textit{Smarthome Manager} needs to resolve such a conflict by prioritizing one user’s goals or activities over the other one. In such a situation, the user whose command has been rejected in favor of other users’ goals might be confused.
