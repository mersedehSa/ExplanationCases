## Autonomous Actions:
Another progressing trend in context-aware smart homes is toward reducing human assistance and making systems more autonomous. In this direction, for example, a self-adaptive system continuously monitors itself, the user, and the environment to learn and optimize rules which let the system autonomously adapt itself to the changing environment and user preferences and activities <sup>[[1]](#1) </sup>. As a result, the system gradually evolves, behaves more intelligently, and independently acts or decides upon something without waiting for users' permissions. Hence, a user is confronted with some already performed actions (or the consequence of performing such actions). Without some explanations, the activity itself, or its underlying cause and benefit might not be understandable for the user.

### Scenario:
  > Bob has invited a couple of his friends to a party in his home. Suddenly, at midnight, the system turns off a couple of lights, changes the light color of others to blue, lowers the volume of the Amazon Echo playing some music, and locks the main door! Everyone, including Bob, is surprised and wonders what happened! The system, however, just followed the newly adopted rule: to put the smart-home to "bedtime mode'' at midnight learned from Bob's routine in the last couple of weeks!
