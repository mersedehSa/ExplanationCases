## Disobedience
Most often, the situation that users attempt to command a system and the system does not respond and execute the order leaves users baffled. In many cases, however, such disobedience is indeed not simply breaking the rules, but it occurs because the system is following some other rules or goals which are not very obvious for the user at that moment, or it is incapable of accomplishing the instructions due to some constraints or system conditions. In the following, we present the more specific Disobedience cases.
