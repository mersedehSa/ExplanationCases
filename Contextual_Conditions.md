## Contextual Conditions:
Sometimes the system chooses to avoid following a user's command due to its contextual awareness and comprehensive knowledge. The system may anticipate that the ordered action may lead to some undesirable situation or concludes the requested operation is not the best possible course of action in compliance with some rules, goals, or user preferences. 

### Scenario:
> Bob receives a notification on his phone from the washing machine saying that the washing is completed. Bob then commands Coco, his assistance robot, to collect the clothes and hang them on the rack on the balcony. Coco, however, does not move to the washing machine. Bob repeats the order again but still no response from Coco! He is wondering if something is wrong with Coco! However, Coco's behavior is due to its awareness of the high chance of rain in the next few hours!
